# Mandelbrot-rs

This is just a small script to try out Mandelbrot in Rust for myself. It achieves around 20-30 million pixels per second on my laptop
Any contributions are welcome!

To make a video yourself, create the folder frames and execute start.sh

## Improvements

- Coordinates have some errors
- Zoom isn't fully functional and doesn't do much for the first half
